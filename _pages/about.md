I am a sophomore at UC Berkeley majoring in EECS. My interest is the intersection of CS theory, artificial intelligence, and their connections to society. I am currently working as an undergraduate researcher in the [C.H.E.N. Lab](https://chenlab.io/), part of [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) and [CPH](https://computationalhealth.berkeley.edu/), led by Professor [Irene Chen](https://irenechen.net/). Here, I am investigating the effect of zero-shot LLM inference on self-supervised learning, advised by Ph.D. candidate [Jichan Chung](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pXQfWTkAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I worked as a research intern at [JLK Inc.](https://jlkgroup.com/en/about/), researching federated learning models applied to MRI image segmentation. During my military service, I was fortunate to be advised by Professor Sejin Park to research defensive techniques against Deep Leakage in federated learning.
