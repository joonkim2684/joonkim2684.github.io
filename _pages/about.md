I am a sophomore at UC Berkeley majoring in EECS. My interest is broadly in the intersection of Theoretical Computer Science and Computational Sciences. Currently, I am independently studying various topics in mathematics and TCS to start getting involved in related research. This summer, I participated in a [SURF-REU program](https://sandip.ece.ufl.edu/reu-22/) at University of Florida and researched automotive security. In Fall 24, I worked as an undergraduate researcher in the [C.H.E.N. Lab](https://chenlab.io/), part of [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) and [CPH](https://computationalhealth.berkeley.edu/), led by Professor [Irene Chen](https://irenechen.net/). There, I investigated the effect of zero-shot LLM inference on self-supervised learning alongside Ph.D. candidate [Jichan Chung](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pXQfWTkAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I worked as a research intern at [JLK Inc.](https://jlkgroup.com/en/about/), researching federated learning models applied to MRI image segmentation. During my military service, I was fortunate to be advised by Professor Sejin Park to research defensive techniques against Deep Leakage in federated learning. In my free time, I usually practice playing the acoustic guitar, watch Netflix or Youtube, or [pick up](./readings) a random CS/Math textbook and hope I understand more than one sentence.
