I am a junior at UC Berkeley majoring in EECS. My interest lies broadly in the complementary dynamics between Theoretical Computer Science and Computational Sciences. I aspire to work in both directions, bringing the Computational Lens to other disciplines as well as being inspired by engineering and sciences for developing theoretical ideas in CS. My experience reflects this, as I have participated in multiple interdisciplinary research projects. Currently, I am working on some open problems in TCS, advised by legendary Professors [Rao](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~satishr/) and [Sinclair](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sinclair/). In my free time, I usually practice playing the acoustic guitar, perform pullups, watch Netflix or YouTube, or [pick up](./readings) a random CS/Math textbook and hope I understand more than one sentence.

  <summary>Detailed Summary</summary>
- I am working with [Xiaosheng Huang](https://www.usfca.edu/faculty/xiaosheng-huang) under the Perlmutter Group on [applying ML to strong lens modeling](https://highredshift.github.io/lens-modeling.html).
- Last summer, I participated in a [SURF-REU program](https://sandip.ece.ufl.edu/reu-22/) at University of Florida and researched automotive security, led by Professor Sandip Ray. 
- In Fall 24, I worked as an undergraduate researcher in the [C.H.E.N. Lab](https://chenlab.io/), affiliated with [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) and [CPH](https://computationalhealth.berkeley.edu/), led by Professor [Irene Chen](https://irenechen.net/). There, I investigated the effect of zero-shot LLM inference on self-supervised learning alongside Ph.D. candidate [Jichan Chung](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pXQfWTkAAAAJ&hl=en). 
- Previously, I worked as a research intern at [JLK Inc.](https://jlkgroup.com/en/about/), researching federated learning models applied to MRI image segmentation. 
- During my military service in 2023, I was fortunate to be advised by Professor Sejin Park to research defensive techniques against Deep Leakage in federated learning.
- In Spring 22, I started my research journey with a URAP program in [Studio.geo](https://studiogeo.berkeley.edu/) in the Geography department at Berkeley, led by Professor Clancy Wilmott. There, I explored uses and limitations of Generative AI models in generating 'fake' maps.
