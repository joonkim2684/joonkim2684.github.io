description: Personal record of my (often messy and informal) attempts on self-learning various topics outside college coursework. "Complete" readings do not mean that I have read the book from cover to cover but rather that I was satisfied with moving on to the next topic. I might return to them upon reassessment, so it might be more fitting to call them "dormant." Finally, these are not to be considered serious efforts at studying these topics, although some are indeed closely related to my academic interests.
