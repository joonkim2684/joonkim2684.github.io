Hello! I am launching my personal homepage, and this finally gave me enough excuse to start a blog channel.

I am currently a sophomore studying computer science at UC Berkeley. My interest is on the broad spectrum of CS theory, artificial intelligence, and how those concepts actually get applied to reality.

I envision this blog space to be mostly devoted to a mixture of paper reviews, book reviews, algorithm explanations (mostly for my reviewing's sake), personal endeavors at learning new stuff, and maybe some life updates.

Upload frequency would probably be extremely irregular. I will not attempt to upload a blog post just because it's been a while. But who knows? I might get addicted later on. Or this just may as well be the first and last blog post ever.

Lastly, thank you for visiting my barren website (for now!).
